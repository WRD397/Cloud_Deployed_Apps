    <h1>INTRO TO RECKET SCIENCE</h1>
    <img src="Apollo_Pad_Abort_Test_-2.jpg">
    <h2><b>ROCKET</b></h2>
    <h4>INTRO</h4>
    <p>A rocket (from Italian: rocchetto,
        lit. 'bobbin/spool')[nb 1][1] is a spacecraft, aircraft, vehicle or projectile
        that obtains thrust from a rocket engine. Rocket engine exhaust is formed entirely from propellant carried
        within the rocket.[2] Rocket engines work by action and reaction and push rockets forward simply by expelling
        their
        exhaust in the opposite direction at high speed, and can therefore work in the vacuum of space.</p>
    <p>In fact, <b>rockets work more efficiently in the vacuum of space</b> than in an atmosphere. Multistage rockets
        are capable
        of attaining escape velocity from Earth and therefore can achieve unlimited maximum altitude. Compared with
        airbreathing engines, rockets are lightweight and powerful and capable of generating large accelerations. To
        control
        their flight, rockets rely on momentum, airfoils, auxiliary reaction engines, gimballed thrust, momentum wheels,
        deflection of the exhaust stream, propellant flow, spin, or gravity.</p>

    <h4>HISTORY</h4>
    <p>The first gunpowder-powered rockets evolved in medieval China under the Song dynasty by the 13th century.
        They also developed an early form of MLRS during this time. The Mongols adopted Chinese rocket technology and
        the
        invention spread via the Mongol invasions to the Middle East and to Europe in the mid-13th century.[4] Rockets
        are
        recorded[by whom?] in use by the Song navy in a military exercise dated to 1245. Internal-combustion rocket
        propulsion is mentioned in a reference to 1264, recording that the "ground-rat", a type of firework, had
        frightened the Empress-Mother Gongsheng at a feast held in her honor by her son the Emperor Lizong.[5]
        Subsequently, rockets are included in the military treatise Huolongjing, also known as the Fire Drake Manual,
        written by the Chinese artillery officer Jiao Yu in the mid-14th century. This text mentions the first known
        multistage rocket, the 'fire-dragon issuing from the water' (Huo long chu shui), thought to have been used
        by the Chinese navy.[6]</p>

    <p>Medieval and early modern rockets were used militarily as incendiary weapons in sieges. Between 1270 and 1280,
        Hasan
        al-Rammah wrote al-furusiyyah wa al-manasib al-harbiyya (The Book of Military Horsemanship and Ingenious War
        Devices),
        which included 107 gunpowder recipes, 22 of them for rockets.[7][8] In Europe, Konrad Kyeser described rockets
        in his
        military treatise Bellifortis around 1405.[9]</p>


    <p>William Congreve at the bombardment of Copenhagen (1807)
        The name "rocket" comes from the Italian rocchetta, meaning "bobbin" or "little spindle", given due to the
        similarity
        in shape to the bobbin or spool used to hold the thread from a spinning wheel. Leonhard Fronsperger and Conrad
        Haas
        adopted the Italian term into German in the mid-16th century; "rocket" appears in English by the early 17th
        century.
        [1] Artis Magnae Artilleriae pars prima, an important early modern work on rocket artillery, by Casimir
        Siemienowicz
        , was first printed in Amsterdam in 1650.</p>
